At this time, using git to develop is quite new to me [Jonathan Campbell]
so I am writing notes here to assist:


# Setting up development
- Get your SSH private key from the firewall (mine is: git@firewall.impactstudiopro.com:/data/git/ssh-keys/Jonathan-Campbell/git_rsa)
- If ssh-agent is not already running, start ssh-agent by typing eval `ssh-agent`
- Add your SSH private key with: ssh-add <path to your private key>

# get the code
git clone ssh://git@firewall.impactstudiopro.com/~/builder-v4.git
# make the firewall the default push location
git push origin master

# adding changed or new files
git add <files>

# commit changed/new files
git commit -a

# push to server
git push
